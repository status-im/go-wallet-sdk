# Multicall3

`Multicall3` has two main use cases:

- Aggregate results from multiple contract reads into a single JSON-RPC request.
- Execute multiple state-changing calls in a single transaction.

## Use it when

- You need a known Multicall3 contract address per chain.
- You want Go bindings to interact with the Multicall3 contract.

## Key entrypoints

- `GetMulticall3Address(chainID)` (in `deployments.go`)
- Go bindings in `multicall3.go`

Go bindings [`multicall3.go`](./multicall3.go) autogenerated with
```
solc --abi IMulticall3.sol -o build
abigen --abi build/IMulticall3.abi --pkg multicall3 --out multicall3.go
```

## Deployments

[`deployments.go`](./deployments.go) provides the contract address for different chains. It is generated using the [`deployments`](./deployments/) util, which consumes [`deployments.json`](https://github.com/mds1/multicall3/blob/main/deployments.json).
To regenerate the file:

```
cd deployments
go run .
```
