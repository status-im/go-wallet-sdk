This directory contains accounts for testing.
The password that unlocks them is "foobar".

The "good" key files which are supposed to be loadable are:

- File: UTC--2025-11-14T16-35-58.315139000Z--f33cf2d0309dc4e8518d4df7bf94fd64d0cae9bb--ext

- File: zzz

The other files (including this README) are broken in various ways
and should not be picked up by package accounts:

- File: no-address (missing address field, otherwise same as "aaa")
- File: garbage (file with random data)
- File: empty (file with no content)
- File: .hiddenfile (should be skipped)
- File: foo/... (should be skipped because it is a directory)
